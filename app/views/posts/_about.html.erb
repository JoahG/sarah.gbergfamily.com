My name is Sarah Gerstenberg and I've lived most of my life in Port Arthur, Texas. The eldest of 7 children, I was homeschooled K-12th grade. After graduating high school in 2012, I went on to graduate from Art Instruction Schools of Minneapolis, MN in 2014. I am now pursuing a double degree in Art and Music. <%= link_to 'Read More...', about_path %>
